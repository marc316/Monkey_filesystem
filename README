Monkey Filesystem
=================

This project is an EXPERIMENT which aims to add a cache layer between web
servers and a target file system when serving static content.

The basic idea of this virtual (caching) filesystem , is to mount a virtual
filesystem based in FUSE which re-map an existent directory content, so the
web server configures its virtual host document root to this new mount point.


The workflow is as follows:
---------------------------

- Web server perform different FS operations: open(2), read(2), stat(2), etc.

- The file system checks if contains some cached data for the requested
  operation, if it have, it returns the cache content, otherwise it ask the
  native file system for that data, populate the cache and sends the results
  back.

Why ?
-----

Implementing a generic and agnostic file system cache for web servers empower
the system administrator to accomodate the cache behavior to it business needs
and HW capacity.

Some problems solved are:

 - All web servers implements different cache mechanisms and expose a poor setup
   over it cache behavior.

 - Not all web servers provides information about it cached information.

 - Cannot modify the cache memory size on-fly.
